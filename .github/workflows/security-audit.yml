# =============================================================================
# Security Audit Workflow
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Daily security scan for HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities only.
# Runs on: Push to main/develop, PRs to main, and daily at 2 AM UTC.
# 
# This workflow is intentionally lenient - it only fails on HIGH/CRITICAL
# production vulnerabilities. Moderate dev dependency issues are logged but
# do not fail the build.
