# Security Audit Workflow
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Security scan that uses the project's custom audit script.
# 
# The custom script (npm run security:audit) is more intelligent than raw
# npm audit - it distinguishes between production and dev vulnerabilities
# and only fails on genuinely critical issues.
#
# Runs on: Push to main/develop, PRs to main, and daily at 2 AM UTC.
