    <h2>2. Strategic Preparation Framework</h2>
    
    <h3>The SOAR Method</h3>
    <p>Successful aviation interview preparation follows the SOAR framework: <strong>S</strong>tudy (technical knowledge), <strong>O</strong>rganize (documentation and logistics), <strong>A</strong>nalyze (company research and self-assessment), and <strong>R</strong>ehease (practice and refinement). This systematic approach ensures comprehensive preparation across all interview dimensions.</p>

    <h4>Study Phase (4-6 weeks before interview)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Knowledge Review:</strong> Aircraft systems, regulations, procedures</li>
      <li><strong>Industry Awareness:</strong> Current events, market trends, safety developments</li>
      <li><strong>Company Research:</strong> Airline history, fleet, routes, culture, recent news</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory Updates:</strong> Latest DGCA circulars, international standards</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Organize Phase (2-3 weeks before interview)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Certificates, logbooks, recommendations organized</li>
      <li><strong>Logistics Planning:</strong> Travel, accommodation, interview location research</li>
      <li><strong>Professional Presentation:</strong> Attire, grooming, equipment preparation</li>
      <li><strong>Reference Preparation:</strong> Contact and brief your references</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Technical Interview Mastery</h2>
    
    <h3>Core Technical Areas</h3>
    <p>Technical interviews assess your foundational aviation knowledge and practical application abilities. Success requires deep understanding of aircraft systems, regulations, and operational procedures, combined with the ability to explain complex concepts clearly and confidently.</p>

    <h4>Aircraft Systems Knowledge</h4>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>System Category</th><th>Key Focus Areas</th><th>Typical Questions</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Powerplant</td><td>Engine operations, fuel systems</td><td>Engine failure procedures, fuel planning</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Flight Controls</td><td>Primary/secondary controls, automation</td><td>Control system failures, manual reversion</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Electrical</td><td>Power generation, distribution, backup</td><td>Generator failures, battery operations</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hydraulics</td><td>System operations, backups, failures</td><td>Multiple hydraulic failures, manual reversion</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>Regulatory Knowledge Essentials</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flight Time Limitations:</strong> DGCA requirements for commercial operations</li>
      <li><strong>Weather Minimums:</strong> VFR/IFR requirements, alternate airport rules</li>
      <li><strong>Emergency Procedures:</strong> Regulatory requirements for different emergencies</li>
      <li><strong>International Standards:</strong> ICAO requirements for international operations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical Question Categories</h3>
    
    <h4>Scenario-Based Questions</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> "You're on approach in IMC conditions when you lose your primary attitude indicator. Your backup displays are functional. Describe your actions and decision-making process."</p>
      <p><strong>Response Framework:</strong> Acknowledge the failure → Assess available resources → Prioritize flight safety → Execute appropriate procedures → Communicate with ATC → Brief cabin crew if necessary → Complete approach or execute missed approach based on conditions.</p>
