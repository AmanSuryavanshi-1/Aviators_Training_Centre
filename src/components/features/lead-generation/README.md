## Lead Generation Strategy

### Data Capture Points
1. **Tool Completion**: Full results and user responses
2. **Progress Tracking**: Partial completion and abandonment points

### Conversion Optimization
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Gradual information collection
- **Social Proof**: Success stories and testimonials
- **Urgency Elements**: Limited-time offers and deadlines
- **Risk Reduction**: Guarantees and free consultations

## Analytics and Tracking

### Key Metrics

- **Conversion Rates**: Tool completion to lead conversion
- **Engagement Time**: Average time spent per tool
- **Drop-off Points**: Where users abandon tools
- **Lead Quality**: Scoring and qualification metrics

### Event Tracking
```typescript
interface LeadGenerationEvent {
  id: string;
  userId?: string;
  toolType: 'quiz' | 'assessment' | 'calculator' | 'eligibility';
  eventType: 'started' | 'completed' | 'abandoned' | 'converted';
