## Performance Optimization

### Optimization Script (`scripts/optimize-performance.ts`)

Automated performance analysis and optimization script.

**Features:**
- Performance metric analysis
- Cache optimization recommendations
- Database query optimization

- Automated optimization application

**Usage:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/optimize-performance.ts
```

**Output:**
- Performance optimization report
- Recommendations for improvements
- Overall system health score
- Detailed analysis of slow operations

## Integration with Blog Services

The monitoring system is integrated throughout the blog system:

### Unified Blog Service Integration

```typescript
// Performance monitoring for all operations
async getAllPosts(options) {
  return withPerformanceMonitoring(
    'blog-get-all-posts',
    async () => {
      return queryOptimizer.executeOptimizedQuery(
        'blog-listing',
        async () => {
          // Fetch logic here
        },
        options
      );
    }
  );
}
```

### Error Tracking Integration

```typescript
// Error tracking for Sanity operations
private async fetchFromSanity() {
  return withErrorTracking(
    'sanity-fetch-posts',
    async () => {
      // Sanity fetch logic
    },
    {},
    'high'
  );
}
```
